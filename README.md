# Design Goal

This project is part of a collaborative installation project with the theme Fall. View the [video compilation here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipONnzwL7uUN3IeL-OUf6BFHrQKdBk-7g2W0JWsO20C7CtgCtx0W3o83k9T2R3dHAA/photo/AF1QipP87Gdsf4yeNogqX8H-DZfTtOCwjjSSaB2Ae6kb?key=SHl4WDBCSmJucXZTTXdZbUJtazB0bnhfT3pOSlNn) for the whole design.

The inspiration for this project comes from my childhood memory of the fall season in China, where dried persimmons hang from strings in the crisp air, gently swaying in the wind. 

The Chinese character for persimmon “柿” is also pronounced the same as “事“ (thing, work). There is an idiom usually showing up in the red envelope “事事如意“ (everything works out as wishes) during winter and Chinese New Year, and we would often see “柿柿如意” being used homophonically as “事“.

# Installation

### Material used

- ESP32 TTGO T-display
- Lipo battery
- Paper envelop & string (for wrapping and hanging the ESP32 display)

### Instruction

- Connect ESP32 to your computer
    - Some useful resources
        - [Instruction for setting up TTGO T-display](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Display)
        - Install the ESP 32 library following the [instruction](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html) under `Installing using Arduino IDE`
        - Install `tft_espi` by Bodmer under Arduino Library Manger
- Download the `persimmons.ino` file and open it in Arduino IDE
- Upload the code
- You will be able to see the screen lights up and the swinging persimmons!
- Plug in the Lipo battery
- Wrap the display with the paper envelop using tape

### Decorating the Envelop

If you want to make the display fancier,  you can add more drawing to the envelop before attaching the hardware.
